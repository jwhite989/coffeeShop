          <p>
            At <strong>A Bean Above</strong>, coffee is more than a drink — it's
            a ritual of warmth, community, and craftsmanship. Every cup is
            brewed from responsibly sourced beans, roasted in small batches to
            bring out their richest flavors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're stopping in for your morning espresso or relaxing
            with a caramel macchiato, we’re here to make your day a little
            brighter — one sip at a time.
